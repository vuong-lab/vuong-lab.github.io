# <i class="fas fa-hands-helping"></i>Lab values

We are committed to promoting scientific training, pursuing rigorous research, and advancing scientific discoveries **as a team**. We are dedicated to building an inclusive and supportive lab environment that will **foster your scientific development and enable you to achieve your goals**. 

We believe everyone, regardless of race, ethnicity, nationality, gender identity, different physical abilities, should have the opportunity to learn and pursue science. We oppose racism, discrimination, and hate through allyship, continuous learning and listening.

We will pursue scientific discovery with honesty, integrity, and rigor. We encourage collaboration, communication, and promoting science across multiple platforms. Acknowledging that science is advanced through the discoveries of others, we will make scientific discoveries open access, cite previous discoveries, and pursue science with the utmost precision and transparency.
